    **Smart Energy Use: Less Waste, More Savings**
    
    Energy efficiency means using less energy to provide the same level of comfort and service.
    
    **Home Energy Efficiency:**
    - Switch to LED light bulbs (90% less energy)
    - Unplug devices when not in use (phantom loads)
    - Use programmable thermostats
    - Improve insulation and seal air leaks
    - Choose ENERGY STAR appliances
    
    **Behavioral Changes:**
    - Turn off lights when leaving rooms
    - Use natural light when possible
    - Air dry clothes instead of using dryer
    - Take shorter hot showers
    - Use fans instead of AC when possible
    
    **School Energy Actions:**
    - Start energy patrol teams
    - Monitor classroom energy use
    - Educate peers about conservation
    - Organize energy-saving competitions
    - Advocate for efficient school equipment
    
    **Benefits of Energy Efficiency:**
    - Reduces utility bills
    - Decreases pollution
    - Extends appliance life
    - Improves comfort levels

    **Harnessing Nature's Power: Renewable Energy Revolution**
    
    Renewable energy sources provide clean, sustainable power that doesn't deplete natural resources.
    
    **Solar Energy:**
    - Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight to electricity
    - Solar thermal systems heat water directly
    - Can be installed on rooftops or in solar farms
    - Works even on cloudy days (reduced efficiency)
    
    **Wind Energy:**
    - Wind turbines convert air movement to electricity
    - Can be onshore or offshore installations
    - Most effective in areas with consistent winds
    - Small turbines available for homes/schools
    
    **Hydroelectric Power:**
    - Uses flowing or falling water to generate electricity
    - Can range from large dams to micro-hydro systems
    - Very reliable and long-lasting
    - Minimal ongoing fuel costs
    
    **Other Renewable Sources:**
    - **Geothermal**: Uses Earth's internal heat
    - **Biomass**: Burns organic materials sustainably
    - **Tidal**: Harnesses ocean tide movements
    
    **Benefits of Renewables:**
    - Zero fuel costs after installation
    - Minimal environmental impact
    - Creates local jobs
    - Reduces dependence on imports
    - Helps fight climate change
